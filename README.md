This is our thesis Project. It is named QR WARP code. WARP because it came from our names ([W]illand, [A]llene, [R]alph, [P]aolo).

This project is about transferring text files and images (limited only to .JPG and .PNG files) securely via QR Codes.

The process of encryption:
      > encrypting the file, whether it may be a text file or an image file
      > then hide the encrypted file inside the QR Code via steganography 
      > give the encrypted QR WARP Code.
      
The process of decryption:
      > give the encrpyted QR WARP Code.
      > extract encrypted file via steganography then decrypt encrypted file
      > give the image or the plain text.


It has a lot of limitations:
      1.) It does not accept other file types like .docx, .pptx, .pdf, .gif, .mov, .mp4, .mp3, and others.
          It only accepts .txt, .png, and .jpg.
      2.) The password you'll give should be exactly 8 characters long. Not less than 8, not more than 8.
      3.) Currently, it's not a mobile app.
      4.) This project has not been updated since our final defense.
