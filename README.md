This is our thesis Project. It is named QR WARP code. WARP because it came from our names ([W]illand, [A]llene, [R]alph, [P]aolo).

This project is about transferring text files and images (limited only to .JPG and .PNG files) securely via QR Codes.

The process of encryption:
      > encrypting the file, whether it may be a text file or an image file
      > then hide the encrypted file inside the QR Code via steganography 
      > give the encrypted QR WARP Code.
      
The process of decryption:
      > give the encrpyted QR WARP Code.
      > extract encrypted file via steganography then decrypt encrypted file
      > give the image or the plain text.
